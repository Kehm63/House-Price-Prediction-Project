# House-Price-Prediction-Project
In this project, a machine learning model will be developed to forecast home prices based on a variety of variables, including the median household income, the average age of the housing stock, the number of rooms and bedrooms, etc. The project makes predictions using the linear regression model and data from a housing dataset from kaggle.

## Python Libraries used :
scikit learn - For the model building
matplotlib - for visualizations.

The Scikit-learn library's LinearRegression model is utilized to create the prediction model. The train_test_split function divides the dataset into training and testing data, and the model is trained using the training data.

Using the model.score() function, the trained model is evaluated and scored yielding an accuracy score of 71.6 percent. The accuracy could be improved if more enhanced machine learning techniques are applied.
